                <p class="first-paragraph">Last summer was the fourth hottest on record for Syracuse, New York, and things are expected to keep heating up looking forward. 
                </p>
                <p>According to the National Weather Service, the average temperature in Syracuse during the months of June, July and August 2024 was 73.3 degrees. This was 4.1 degrees above the average for the same period since 1903, when the weather service's climate record began. 
                </p>
                <p>Because of climate change, Lead Meteorologist at National Weather Service Binghamton Michael Murphy said that summers through the next century will likely involve, on average, higher daily maximum temperatures and more frequent days over 90 degrees.  
                </p>
                <p>Heat can cause dehydration, heat stroke, cramps, and heat exhaustion, as well as worsen preexisting medical conditions like asthma, said Erin Clary, deputy director of communications at the New York State Department of Health. </p>
                <p>“Everyone is at risk for heat-related illness, but older adults, children, people who work outdoors, and people with existing health conditions are at more risk of getting sick when it's hot,” Clary said. “Some groups of people may be more vulnerable than others. This includes people without access to a cool space.” 
            </p>
                <p>Murphy said people who work outside in warm conditions can reduce the risk of heat related injury by dressing appropriately for the weather, staying hydrated, and taking breaks whenever possible in shaded or air-conditioned spaces. The weather service advocates these strategies and also works to help people on a systemic level. 
                </p>
                  <p>“We're trying to help communities to find easy and affordable access to air conditioning, especially those that could be disproportionately affected by rising temperatures and heat waves,” said Murphy. “Hopefully that'll help mitigate these heat related issues.”

              <p>A multitude of institutions in Syracuse and Onondaga County serve as “cooling centers,” places where residents can cool down and shelter from extreme heat. <a href="https://apps.health.ny.gov/statistics/environmental/public_health_tracking/tracker/#/CCList">These centers</a> are organized by county and publicized by the NYSDOH.  
              </p>
              <p>Director Meg Van Patten said the Baldwinsville Public Library has been designated one of these cooling centers since the term came into use. The NYSDOH quickly recognized the air conditioning services the library was already providing. 
              </p><p>Van Patten explained that the library has developed strong ties to the community through continuous outreach events and partnerships with other local groups.</p> 
            </p>
                  <p>“Those things help us to have people get to know us, and then they think of us when they have a need,” Van Patten said. “We have had people say, 'Oh it's so hot,' you know, and they say that's why they came in because they came to cool off. Just that they appreciate how it's so nice and cool in here.”

              <p>Over the summer, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced the release of the <a href="https://dec.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/extremeheatactionplan.pdf">Extreme Heat Action Plan</a>, an interagency agenda for 2024-2030 focused on adapting New York state to extreme heat. This plan is intended to address the needs of heat vulnerable communities as the state prepares for more frequent and severe extreme heat events in the coming years. Action items include deploying zero-emissions buses along transit routes, modifying state building codes to take extreme heat into account, and securing additional funding for cooling equipment to make it more accessible.
