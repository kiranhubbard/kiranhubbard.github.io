            <p>SYRACUSE, N.Y. - It's the first snowfall of the year at Syracuse University, and sophomore Abby Luca is on her way to a snowball fight in the quadrangle with her fraternity “big sister” Maddy de Vera. </p>
            <p>Throwing snow at each other in the freezing cold is just one of many adventures the two have shared. Luca is always willing to try anything and everything, according to de Vera.</p>
            <p>“She's one of the first people I text when I say “hey let's do this crazy stupid idea,” and she's always on board,” de Vera said. </p>
            <p>	Luca showcases this openness in every aspect of her life, including her creative expression. Her website, <a href="https://thedailygail.wixsite.com/thedailygail">thedailygail</a>, contains written pieces addressing her relationships, disordered eating and recovery, and divorce. Although writing about such emotional experiences may seem daunting to some, she welcomes the opportunity to convey thoughts that other people keep pent up. </p>
            <p>	“I really got into writing while in recovery for my eating disorder, I used it as a way to cope,” said Luca. “I publish my writing and stuff so people can relate to me, and just be connected to another human… I want other people to know they're not alone.” </p>
            <p>Luca accomplished publication even before coming to college, along with going viral on TikTok; she inspires the people around her with her dedication to excelling at everything she does. For de Vera, this drive shines through in a passage from Luca's story “To Be a Body.”</p>
            <p>“In the end, our bodies are only statues for the mind and heart to rest within, thus let your character convey what your physicality cannot,” wrote Luca.</p>
            <p>De Vera is constantly impressed by Luca's skillful prose and the way her words speak to readers beyond the surface level. </p>
            <p>“Abby's writing is beautiful. Her mind works wonders, I honestly don't know how she does it. [She] does a great job at incorporating her own personal experiences, and then just talking about body dysmorphia as a general whole,” de Vera said. </p>
            <p>As a dual creative writing and journalism major, Luca often feels the challenge of reconciling such oppositional writing styles. She decided to pursue journalism to make a difference and discuss real issues; however, she has had to learn when to disregard descriptive imagery in favor of concise reporting. </p>
            <p>“I like eloquent words, I like them to paint a picture, I like it to be beautiful… But in journalism you kinda have to be hard-hitting: you want to paint a picture, but it can't be with colorful paints, it has to be like a sketch. So it is very difficult,” Luca shared.</p>
            <p>Although her semi-famous social media accounts typically diverge from the content discussed in her work, Luca's heightened online presence has given her the reach to touch people's lives from across the globe. Visitors to her website can be traced back to India, England, France, and even locations she hadn't ever known of.  </p>
            <p>Luca wants everyone who reads her stories anywhere in the world to feel something and to see how much of an outlet writing can be. She looks back on the progression of her work with pride, and hopes readers feel inspired by her experience with eating disorder recovery to push themselves to do better. </p>
            <p>“I want people to not only relate to that, but to want to heal themselves and to want to love themselves the way I do now,” Luca said. </p>
