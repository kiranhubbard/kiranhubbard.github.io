                <h2>Exploring the implications of supporting LGBTQ+ pride in a journalistic landscape</h2>

                <p>For many, attending pride parades is a celebration of identity and an important show of support for members of the LGBTQ+ community. However, for the Allentown, Pennsylvania Morning Call features and history column writer Frank Whelan, attending a parade in 2006 altered the course of his career and life. When Whelan co-marshaled a gay rights parade with his partner Bob Wittman in June of that year, he was met with significant backlash from his newspaper's higher-ups. Whelan's editors warned him not to participate in the parade ahead of time, claiming that it violated their ethics code: employees were not allowed to take part in public demonstrations for a cause. The editors also stated that they only learned about Whelan's involvement from a press release by a different publication, not through his informing them. Due to the negative reactions by his bosses, Whelan took two days off of work - which was later deemed an unpaid suspension by his editors. He filed three lawsuits against the paper, for sexual and age discrimination as well as defamation, and all were settled outside of court. The paper agreed to two years of severance pay and medical benefits. (“Reigning on the Parade”) 
                </p>
                <p>	The primary ethical concern in this situation is whether or not journalists have the right to show public support for causes. The Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) Code of Ethics states that “Journalists should: Avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived. Disclose any unavoidable conflicts.” This is often applied to journalists showing political leanings, which is usually seen as an apparent conflict of interest since readers are less likely to trust that their reporting is not biased in favor of their proclaimed opinions. In this situation, the argument would be whether Whelan's demonstration of support for gay pride presents a real or perceived conflict of interest in his reporting which would damage his credibility and/or relationship with his readers. There are further layers to this concern, which involve the classification of gay pride as a cause: does pride necessarily equate to legalized gay marriage? If so, is this truly a political issue, or is it a human rights issue? Is it acceptable for journalists to demonstrate support for one or not the other? </p>
                <p>Whelan shared his plan to file a civil rights lawsuit against his paper with The Associated Press on June 23, 2006, which appears to be how The Morning Call learned of his intent. This interview with AP seems to be the main source of information about the case, and the basis of most other news outlet's stories. There was not a significant amount of coverage of this event, and the Associated Press does not have a record of any formal article or news piece on their interview. The Morning Call's coverage of these events focuses heavily on the technical violation that Whelan committed and does not comment on whether or not he was punished for his parade attendance. (“Columnist: Call suspended me for riding”) The SPJ's article on Whelan dives much deeper into the broader ethical implications of this situation, including discussing different stakeholders and what they had to lose by taking certain actions, instead of focusing on the cut-and-dry timeline of events. (“Reigning on the Parade”) The news website Advocate published a short piece sharing the editor of The Morning Call and Whelan's differing perspectives on the events and how they transpired. (“Newspaper columnist in dispute”) Poynter posted a short update on the story on June 22, 2006, which quoted Whelan and gave a platform for his perspective. (“Whelan hasn't returned”) Most of the other coverage of this event is in the form of ethical case study projects - much like this one - posted to blogs or other personal sites, with the author's take and opinion included in the writing. </p>
                <p>Nora Neus is a professional journalist who has written for outlets including The Washington Post, Poynter, CNN, and more. She primarily covers worldly issues with the intent to affect change and keeps a strong focus on ethical journalism. About this specific case, Neus shared that she did not think there was any kind of ethical violation on Whelan's part, and he should not have been punished for celebrating his queer identity. More broadly, Neus believes there cannot be a clear line drawn between human rights and political issues when so many civil rights have been politicized. For instance, although Whelan's case likely would not have been a problem if it occurred today - because support for queer identities is now in the realm of “acceptable” views to hold - showing support for some other marginalized groups of people, such as by attending Black Lives Matter protests, is often seen as too controversial for journalists. Furthermore, she holds the view that journalistic integrity is strengthened by transparency and the open sharing of journalist's personal views.  
                </p>
                <p>“I would way rather read an article with someone who discloses what their personal viewpoint is, or their personal, like, attachment to the issue, and then still does accurate ethical reporting,” said Neus. “We're all coming from somewhere, there is no objective. The cis, white, heterosexual, Presbyterian man in this country is not objective and is not neutral, either. And so, I think there has to be change more broadly, which will help people trust media more in the long run, I think, because they'll understand that we're all human beings doing this job.” 
                </p>
                <p>Syracuse University Newhouse professor and Magazine, News, and Digital Journalism Department Chair Aileen Gallagher agreed that she would not have punished Whelan and that there likely would have been no issue with his attendance at the parade if this was a contemporary case. However, she added that public perception of Whelan as a journalist could be altered by his attendance, and the magnitude of these implications would depend on contextual factors such as the political landscape. In general, she believes that journalists are better able to serve their communities without publishing their values and advocating for causes, despite the resistance that younger journalists tend to feel towards this trade-off. 
                </p>
                <p>“I think journalists just play a different role. And that we bring light on issues that are important to us in different ways than going out on the streets,” said Professor Gallagher. “I wish that people valued the journalism piece enough that they could view it as… their contribution to the cause.”

                <p>Finally, Syracuse University sophomore and Magazine, News, and Digital Journalism student Kacie Moschella feels that even though Whelan technically violated his newspaper's ethics code by attending the parade, the code itself was unethical and should not have been in place. She continued that specifically this situation would likely not be an issue today because gay rights have become much more commonly accepted in the past two decades, and that it never should have been considered an ethical dilemma to support human rights. Moschella also stated her opinion that journalists who do not write or report on political beats have the right to express their values on social media and in public, and doing so does not represent a threat to their credibility or ethical journalism. 
                </p>
                <p>Overall, when focusing on this specific case study, the consensus is that Whelan did not commit an ethical violation in his co-marshaling of a pride parade. Perspectives begin to get more varied when diving into the broader issues behind this case, such as what constitutes a political versus human rights topic and whether or not journalists can show their support for different causes. Many “traditional” journalists are more inclined to believe in harsher restrictions on what reporters can and cannot publicly announce. They often believe that sharing personal opinions on controversial topics is too much of a threat to a writer's credibility and relationship with their audience, and some even refrain from voting to keep consistent with these principles. On the other hand, less “traditional” journalists are more likely to share their own beliefs with their audience, either through public demonstrations or social media. Several media organizations, such as NPR, have amended their ethics codes in recent years to align more closely with the latter: journalists at these organizations are theoretically allowed to show public support for issues regarding human rights, but in practice there are still an abundance of questions over how to classify and identify such issues. </p>
                <p>My take on the issue is that human rights are not political, no matter how much they may have been politicized. In the context of the Frank Whalen case, even if his participation in a pride parade was a show of support for marriage equality, I would not consider that a breach of journalistic integrity or means for punishment or suspension. I tend to lean away from the “traditional” journalist point of view, and I think that journalists are people first who have responsibilities as citizens and community members that they should be allowed to participate in if they feel the need to. I do not think this detracts from the quality of their journalism, as long as they are still rigorous in fact-checking and conducting accurate and honest reporting. 
                </p>
                <p>Although Whelan's case may seem distant and irrelevant to today's journalistic landscape, its underlying issues and implications are still a hugely important part of the media sphere. Discussing case studies such as this can help journalists everywhere improve their abilities to uphold ethical standards and effectively serve their communities.
